   <h3>Hi, I'm Agnel John. I began my career as a Software Engineer. As I excelled in the industry, I noticed that many freshers were struggling to secure employment in the market. I found that their struggles arise from their mindset and lack of sufficient understanding about how the real world operates. To address this, I took the initiative to train individuals in both technology and mindset by establishing an academy called "Error Makes Clever." Our motto is not just to enhance their skills but also to empower their minds, enabling them to face the challenges of the real world.
